Diffeomorphic volume above a sphere surface should determine infinitely differentiable probability, do this via altering focus depth of an optical system then measuring the diffeomorphism between the focused and non focused areas of LCD array photons above the sphere. currently use edge detection for manual measurement. look for high or low rebound after unblocking.

TODO: I have to figure out how the observer-system pair causes the mirage. Then contain and parallelize the compute logic.
