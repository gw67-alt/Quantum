Diffeomorphic volume above a sphere surface should determine infinitely differentiable probability, do this via altering focus depth of an optical system then measuring the diffeomorphism between the focused and non focused areas of LCD array photons above the sphere. currently use edge detection for manual measurement. look for high or low rebound after unblocking.

TODO: currently redesigning the test curvature script for stable curve detection


Qubit machine prototype. First I need to figure out how the mirage works. Else a particle in a box technique should suffice for each compute unit. I suppose some type of IR light bath should be sufficient for the probability measurement with the photonic lattice for the mirage.
