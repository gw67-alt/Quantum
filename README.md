The object may have a gradient when event space topography is performed against a near-fixed photonic lattice background that approximates the amplitude of the state space with potential-field control.


AND gates with T-symmetric time obtain the position information from the blocker retrocasually. A cascade continuing over multiple epochs... XOR is where there is no cascade. If a repeated binary choice is aligned forlong enough there will be a cascade.
