An photon emitting atom in a right sized cavity, would simply disappear into a wave, and could have it's energy amplified with electron wave amplification, creating "bright light".


The energy amplification of an electron wave, or how much energy is gained by an electron when it interacts with a wave, depends on the specific wave and the electron's properties. In some cases, electrons can gain energy from waves and be accelerated, potentially reaching energies of several keV
