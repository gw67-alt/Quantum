So a Casimir flange connected into a secondary vessel for pressurization fluctuation would create a resonator...

I suppose a special elastic fluid for the hydraulics.

A zero point energy reactor would fire off 1 square metre resonators at 10 metric tons of force over 10 nanometres distance, with hydraulics it is 0.78 kg of force per plate. 100 plates resonating at ~1Mhz would be 7,650 watts of power.
